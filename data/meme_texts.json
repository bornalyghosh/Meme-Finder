I. Hardy states, “8712 and 9801 are\nthe only four-figure numbers which are integral multiples of their reversals”;\nand, he further comments that “this is not serious theorem, 9s it is not\n‘capable of any signiflcant generalization.”\n\nHowever, Hardy’s comment may have been shortsighted. In 1966, A.\nSutcliffe Bj expanded this obscure fact about reversals. Instead of restricting\nhis study to base 10 integers and their reversals, Sutcliffe generalized the\nproblem to study’all integer solutions of\n\nK(agrt + ayant 4-430 + a9) = apn! + ain?\n\nFayait + ay\nwithn 221< 6 <m0S aj Sn—1foralli, a 4 0,04 #0.

His elegant proof showed that if there exists a 3-digit solution for\nn, then deleting the middle digit gives « 2-digit solution for n. ‘Together with\nSuteliffe’s work, this proved that there exists a 2-digit solution for n if and\nonly if there exists a 3-digit solution for n,",

Objective Bayesians try to find\nprior distributions that formally express ignorance with the hope that the resulting poste-\nrior is, in some sense, objective. Empirical Bayesians estimate the prior distribution from\nthe data. Frequentist Bayesians are those who use Bayesian methods only when the re-\nsulting posterior has good frequency behavior. Thus, the distinction between Bayesian and\nfrequentist inference can be somewhat murky. This has led to much confusion in statistics,\nmachine learning and science.",

We will begin\n\nBy considering the simplest meaningful example, the perfect gas, in order\nto get the central concepts sorted out. In Chap. 2 we will return to complete\nthe solution of that problem, and the results will provide the foundation of\nmuch of the rest of the book.\n\nThe quantum mechanical solution for the energy levels of a particle in a\nbox (with periodic boundary conditions) is\nHq?\n\n2m\n\n(1.1.1)\n\nwhere m is the mass of the particle, 4 = 27h is Planck's constant, and q\n(which we shall call the wave vector) has three components, x, y, and z,\n\ngiven by\nQn\n=) 2, etc. 112\n( *) el (1.1.2)\n\nwhere ¢, = 0, £1, £2, etc. (1.1.3)",

It remains to check that the equation (1) is consistent with our conditions. It\nis evident for primes and clear that (1) can be used even when some 1; are equal to zero.\nLet a = [J], pi and b = []*_, p*. Then according to (1) the Leibnitz rule looks as\n\nB\nwyete\n\nPi\n\nand the consistency is clear. m\n\nFor example\n\n- Sei LAN peas\n(60) = (2? -3-5)' = 60 ( +} +2) =00+2\n\n12 = 92\n\nWe can extend our definition to 0’ = 0, and it is easy to check that this does not contradict\nthe Leibnitz rule.\n\nNote that linearity does not hold in general; for many a,b we have (a +6)!\" # a! +0.\nFurthermore (ab)\" # a\" + 2a't! + 6!\" because we need linearity to prove this. It would be\ninteresting to describe all the pairs (a,) that solve the differential equation (a+b)! =a’ +¥.\nWe can find one of the solutions, (4,8) in our table above.

A 2ategory containing two 2categeric, giving # eategy\n\n3 Why (k)not?\n\nJedrzejowski (Jedraajewski, in pres) raised a question concerning the absence\n‘of any formalism, in Mazzola’s mathematical theory of gestures, to describe\nsestures that inert some characteristics fram other gestutes. The problem of\nsestural ineritance had alread’ been highlighted years before the development\n‘of such a mathematical theory (Cador & Wanderley, 2000). A way to overcome\nthis difclty may be the use of mouoidal tensor eatogories(Yetter, 2001) and of\nJenot theory (Adams, 1994). Duc to it nature a mse este let a, the\nobjectivized trajectory of « point, for example the tip of the conducting baton\n‘may contain repetitions of the same points tn the path. This fact, as pointed\n‘out by Jedrzejewski, ean be easily famed in Knot theory: One cat imagine a\ngesture asa claw path, and we can investigate whether a gestural curve may\nbe reduced to the unknot, or. not. Avery fst ane intuitive example of this\nis the conducting gesture of the right hand, clesed and eyclic, Knot theory is\nrelated to braids, and braided (monoidal) eategories (Bez & Lauda, 2000) are\n‘2 powerful tool of analysis that can be used in gesture theory Jedrasjewsk,\nin pres, 2006). Another comparison between knot theory and gesture theory\nray come from bilan knots, i, the study of the trajectory of a ball on 8\nDillard table. It is possible to study the correspondence between the straight\nlines vlleted i the wall, and aeurve bending on itself describe in knot theory\n(Vaugans & Praytyel, 1908).

Food was in\nshort supply, so he made a trip to a nearby village in search of food. While he was in the village,\na bunch of anti-communist bandits surrounded the town.\n\nThe leader was suspicious of Tamm, who was dressed in city clothes. He demanded to know:\nwhat Tamm did for a living. He explained that he was a university professor looking for food.\n“What subject?,” the bandit leader asked. Tamm replied “I teach mathematics.”\n\n“Mathematics?” said the leader. “OK. Then give me an estimate of the error one makes by\ncutting off a Maclaurin series expansion at the nth term. Do this and you will go free. Fail, and I\nwill shoot you.”\n\nTamm was not just a little astonished. At gunpoint, he managed to work out the answer. He\nshowed it to the bandit leader, who perused it and then declared “Correct! Go home.” Tamm\nnever discovered the name of the bandit.",

We have a short exact\next)\nsequence 0 + Z — C ——+ C* — 0 of abelian groups which “lifts” to a short\nexact sequence 0 > Zept + Ogp: > Of: 0. We define Zep! to be the\nconstant sheaf of “holomorphic” functions into Z. Because of some cohomology\nyoga we have an exact sequence:\n\n043 Z+C4C* + HCP\", Z) + (CP, Opps) + HCP, Of) -\n\nNotice, by papa Serre, that we have H\"(CP*, F®\") = H\"(PL, F) for coherent\nsheaves F on Ph. So we have exactness of\nH\" (Pe, Op) + H* (Pb, Op,) + H?(CP, Z) > H? (PE, Ops) putitrm\nnot mistaken 1 (P2, Ops) = H?(P%, Op.) = 0 and thus,\n\n1 (ph 2icpl\n(PG, Op.) + H?(CP\", Z) is an isomorphism of abelian groups. By this , we\nhave a group homomorphism Pic(CP*) > H?(CP?, Z). in fact, this\n\nhomomorphism sends the isomorphism class of a line bundle L to its first Chern\nRee cat\n\n?",

This trick consists of a 180 rotation of the skateboard about the 2-axis where the\nskater pushes the tail of the board backwards with their back foot. ‘This means that the\nrotation will follow a left-handed orientation. Since this is a rotation about the =-axis\nvwe have that the last veetor in the orthonormal frame is stationary #(t) = (0.0, 1)\nwhile the two first vectors %(t) and (2) will perform a 180 degree rotation in the\nclockwise direction in the xy-plane.

Long ago,\nwhen shepherds wanted to see if two herds of sheep were isomorphic, they\nwould look for a specific isomorphism. In other words, they would line up\nboth herds and try to match each sheep in one herd with a sheep in the\nother. But one day, a shepherd invented decategorification. She realized one\ncould take each herd and ‘count’ it, setting up an isomorphism between it\nand a set of ‘numbers’, which were nonsense words like ‘one, two, three, ...”\nspecially designed for this purpose. By comparing the resulting numbers, she\ncould show that two herds were isomorphic without explicitly establishing\nIn short, the set N of natural numbers was created by\ndecategorifying FinSet, the category whose objects are finite sets and whose\nmorphisms are functions between these.\n\nStarting with the natural numbers, the shepherds then invented the basic\noperations of arithmetic by decategorifying important operations on finite\n: disjoint union, Cartesian product, and so on. We describe this in detail\nin the next section, Later, their descendants found it useful to extend N\nto larger number systems with better formal properties: the integers, the\nrationals, the real and complex numbers, and so on. These make it easier to\nprove a vast range of theorems, even theorems that are just about natural\nnumbers. But in the process, the original connection to the category of finite\nwas obscured.",

Using the mean value theorem of integrals and\nthe isolation of zeros of analytic function, we\ndetermined that all zeros of the function (s) have real\npart equal to, namely, all non-trivial zeros of zeta\nfunction lies on the critical line.

Yes, or No?\nThe answer's, No! Let us start our forensic aueit there ( itis an incomplete equation. Why?\n‘Because i's not even on both sides. Yes. Nature desires action but demands equilirium.\nTherefore, in order for an equation to be fnished/completed both sides ofthe equation must be\n‘equally, balanced.\n\nYet, in the case of 1 x1 =1 we have an unfinished equation.\n\nBecause we have 2 (1)'s on one side of the equation and 1 (1) on the other\nside of the equation.\n\nLot's attempt to balance this equation by:\nFirst, by making sense oft lets label the relative factors:\n\n‘We wil call the fist value of [1}..cnsneeeesnl@)\nao o We will call the second value of [1] w)\nteed ‘We wil cll the third value of [1] on the\n‘opposite end of the\n‘equation ita)\n\n‘Remember the basic laws of common sense. If a) x (b) = (c), then (c) must be some product of\n(@) and (6). Yet, in order for 1 x1 = 1 the value of either (a) or (b) has to be missing from the\nfinal product of (c). Lets not jump the gun, just yet;\n\n“Then, lets try and add (1) to both sides of the equation\n\nao ©\ntet=d\nar\n\n(een =2\nAssociative and Commutative law's...)\n\n3=2\n\n[Associative and Commutative law, \"When (a) and (b) are\nPositive integers, that (a) is to be added to itself as many times as there are\ntunis in (0).\n\n“Then (1) is added to ital (1) time and you get (2). Now, add the\n\n(+1) tothe tet side ofthe equation and also add the plus (+1) tothe right side\n\n‘of the equation and itgives you an answer &=2 and that doesnt look lke the\n“palanced” equation that we wore looking for, does it?",

Its unit is a quantum bit (qubit) and can be considered as a generalization of the\nunit of classical information, a bit. It allows quantum mechanics to be interpreted in terms of\nquantum information, and all physical processes to be seen as informational in a generalized\nsense. This implies a fundamental connection between the physical and material, on the one hand,\nand the mathematical and ideal, on the other hand. Quantum measure unifies them by a common\nand joint informational unit.\n\nFurthermore the approach clears up philosophically how quantum mechanics and general\nrelativity can be understood correspondingly as the holistic and temporal aspect of one and the\nsame, the state of a quantum system, e.g, that of the universe as a whole. The key link between\nthem is the notion of the Bekenstein bound as well as that of quantum temperature. General\nrelativity can be interpreted as a special particular case of quantum gravity. All principles\nunderlain by Einstein (1918) reduce the latter to the former. Consequently their generalization\nand therefore violation addresses directly a theory of quantum gravity.\n\nQuantum measure reinterprets newly the “Bing Bang” theories about the beginning of the\nuniverse, It measures jointly any quantum leap and smooth motion complementary to each other\nand thus, the jump-like initiation of anything and the corresponding continuous proces\nappearance. Quantum measure unifies the “Big Bang” and the whole visible expansion of the\nuniverse as two complementary “halves” of one and the same, the set of all states of the universe\nas a whole. It is a scientific viewpoint to the “creation from nothing”.\n\nof its",

This abstract\ndescribes a working paper that addresses the question: “Do structural\ntopologies differ from algebraic topologies?” Many experimentalist argue\nthat geometry and topology are identical, but how are they different?\nTopologists look to structure as being a method to measure reality. In\ncontrast, many mathematicians argue that topology is just an elementary\npart of geometry that uses geometry as a tool to expand its sense of reality. A\nprerequisite to perform topology is the option to perform algebraic\ngeometry, at least for the majority of groups that study structure. But this\nfinal connection between topology and algebraic geometry is poorly\nunderstood.\n\nThis paper shows that topological structures may be revealed differently\nthan classical structures. Topology gives a “perception” of the structure;\nalgebraic geometry is a tool that lets us “see” the structure. Topological\nstructures can be compared to functional topologies and, consequently, the\nrelationship between algebraic geometry and topology is equally bizarre.\nTopological vs. algebraic geometry have an unclear boundary, allowing a key\ndynamic connection to be overlooked between the two. Also, in spite of the\nfact that most structural topologies and the structures they capture have the\nGame strarture dn both topologies and atlases: thersis'a huge difference in:",

Om Maanens Indflydelse paa Pendelens Bevegelse.\n\n(“Regarding the Moon’s Influence on the Movement of a Pendulum”).\nMagazin for Naturvidenskaberne 2(2), pp. 143-144.\n\nAt the encouragement of Professor Hansteen, as the story goes, Abel was\ngiven the task of calculating the moon’s gravitational pull using a pendulum\non which a measuring apparatus was attached. As he was the editor of\nMagazin for Naturvidenskaberne, Hansteen published Abel’s paper reporting\nhis findings during the spring of 1824. Hoping that the result would serve\nas Abel’s introduction to the academic circles of Europe, Hansteen even sent\nit to Schumacher who served as the editor of Astronomische Nachrichten. As\nit turned out, Abel’s calculations of the gravitational pull of the moon were\nvery wrong (about six orders of magnitude) and so Schumacher refused to\npublish the paper. Worried that he might mention the blunder to his friend\nGauss, Abel was embarrassed and never again ventured into topics outside\nof pure mathematics.",

Also, every element of T is clearly an integer (since, by\nassumption, the integers have no end). Therefore the set of integers is uncount-\nable, as it contains the uncountable set T.

We define the derivative of an integer to be the map sending every prime to 1\nand satisfying the Leibnitz rule. The aim of the article is to consider the basie properties of\nthis map and to show how to generalize the notion to the case of rational and arbitrary real\nnumbers. We make some conjectures and find some connections with Goldbach’s Conjecture\nand the Twin Prime Conjecture.

So for nonzero k,\nhe defined the inverse of the first elliptic integral to be what he called the “sine ampli-\ntude” or sn u. Now, just as in regular trigonometry, where everything else can be built\non the sine function, Jacobi went on to define further elliptic functions, such as the\n“cosine amplitude” function cn u = 1 — smu, and the “delta amplitude” function\ndnu = /1 — Psn%u. He soon found that his new elliptic functions had many similar\nproperties to the familiar trigonometric functions. For example, the regular sine func-\ntion is periodic with period 27r, so that for any integer n, sin(x + 2zn) = sinx. But\nJacobi’s sine amplitude function was doubly periodic; in other words, there were two\ndistinct numbers a and B (both complex, with «/f ¢ R) such that\n\nsn(u + ma) = sn(u + nf) = sn u.",

While derived functors\nin our sense, when exist, are given by Kan extensions, their\nexistence is a strictly stronger property than the existence of\nKan extensions. We show, however, that derived functors exist\nin the cases one expects them to exist. Our definition is espe-\ncially convenient for the description of a passage from an adjoint\npair (F,G) of functors to a derived adjoint pair (LF,RG). In\nparticular, canonicity of such passage is immediate in our\napproach. Our approach makes perfect sense in the context of\noxreategories.\n\nIntroduction\n\n‘This is a new rap on the oldest of stories\nFunetors on abelian categories.\n\nIf the functor is let exact\n\nYou can derive it and that’s a fact.\n\nBut first you must have enough injective\nObjects in the category to stay active.\n\nIf that’s the case_no time to lose;\n\nResolve injectively any way you choose.\nApply the functor and don’t be sore —\n\n‘The sequence ain’t exact no more.\n\nHere comes the part that is the most fun, Sir,\n‘Take homology to get the answer.\n\nOn resolution it don’t depend:\n\nAll are chain homotopy equivalent.\n\nHey, Mama, when your algebra shows a gap\nGo over this Derived Functor Rap.\n\nP.

As many of you know by now, Stefan's recent diagnosis is devastating. His cancer has\nprogressed to Stage 4, which presents him with limited options for treatment. At the moment he is recovering\nfrom surgery and a serious infection which, you can imagine, was the last thing he needed when he's trying to\nrecuperate. But his spirit is strong and he (of course!) has many plans for the creation of some projects that will\namaze and delight you.\n\nAs this situation unfolds, please know that Stefan reads and enjoys your memes, artwork and good wishes. He\nknows how you feel about him and he feels the same toward you. When he's feeling better and he finds the\nright venue, he will reach out personally.\n\nMeanwhile, please consider visiting the GoFundMe page (https: //www.gofundme.com/2tmtqkin) in case you\nhaven't yet had a chance. My apologies for continuing to ask, but it's important. Hard to believe, but fame does\nnot always equal wealth.\n\nI'm grateful for your steadfast kindness and for the affection you've shown to Stefan. This has been an\nincredible outpouring. Thank you all.\n\nStefan Karl Stefansson\n1B hrs - €\n\nAstin og humhyggjan er 6mzeld og svo hjalpleg i gegnum betta allt saman.\nMikid er ég hraerdur og pakklatur.\n\nMemes live on. « r/dankmemes\n1984 points and 286 comments so far on reddit\n\nREDDIT.COM\n\nwie Like @ Share\n\nO08 27%",
